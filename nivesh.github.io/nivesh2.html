            The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the gray/grey wolf,
            is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of
            Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member
            of its family, with males averaging 43–45 kg (95–99 lb) 
            and females 36–38.5 kg (79–85 lb). It is distinguished from
            other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed
            features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter
            fur is long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray in
            color, although nearly pure white, red and brown to black
            also occur. Mammal Species of the World (3rd ed., 2005), 
            a standard reference work in zoology, recognises 38 subspecies
            of C. lupus.</pre></div>
